# PhaserPlanetary game
Exercise project about Javascript and Phaser.js.

Improvising and learning Javascript, Grunt and Phaser.js. Not sure if it will lead to a complete game yet. 

At the moment game is simple 2d spaceship flying game with "planetary gravitation" or "360 gravitation". 

### Ideas for future
* Enemies
* Missions from planet to planet
* Stamina/energy mechanic
